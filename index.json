We study elliptic partial differential equations posed on networks. We prove that linear elliptic operators on networks are infinitesimal generators of strongly continuous semigroups. We then consider applications to parabolic PDEs and we also study the Feller property of the semigroup and study its associated stochastic process.\n","date":1656028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656028800,"objectID":"b8ae38c8e2e97c0a8d3864cf2eb6fb13","permalink":"https://jules-berry.github.io/dissertations/master_thesis/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/dissertations/master_thesis/","section":"dissertations","summary":"Master thesis written under the supervision of Olivier Ley and Francsico Silva.","tags":null,"title":"Elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations on networks and applications","type":"dissertations"},{"authors":["Jules BERRY"],"categories":null,"content":"Note written under the supervision of Nicolas Seguin for the master’s student seminar on the approximation of solutions of transport equations by neural networks.\n","date":1640908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640908800,"objectID":"50aa252f5dd938c422c94ca0f5b63d08","permalink":"https://jules-berry.github.io/dissertations/nn_pde/","publishdate":"2021-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/dissertations/nn_pde/","section":"dissertations","summary":"Note written under the supervision of [Nicolas Seguin](http://seguin.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) for the master's student seminar on the approximation of solutions of transport equations by neural networks.","tags":null,"title":"Réseaux de neurones, approximation et application aux équations de transport linéaires","type":"dissertations"},{"authors":["Jules BERRY"],"categories":null,"content":"Note on the theory of wavelets.
