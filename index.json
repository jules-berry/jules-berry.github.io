For the sake of simplicity, we focus on a simple stationary case. We propose an abstract framework to study these solutions by reformulating the mean field game system as an abstract equation in a Banach space. In this context, stable equilibria turn out to be regular solutions to this equation, meaning that the linearized system is well-posed. We provide three applications of this property: we study the sensitivity analysis of stable solutions, establish error estimates for their finite element approximations, and prove the local converge of Newton's method in infinite dimensions.","tags":null,"title":"Approximation and perturbations of stable solutions to a stationary mean field game system","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!
